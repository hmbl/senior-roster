# Senior Roster

[Preview application](www.hmbl.co.nz/seniorroster)

This application is designed to work as a roster for any amount of staff at a business where staff members take breaks, and work on shift basis.
I work at a supermarket and part of my job is to take care of the rostered staff, and issue their break times and home time. 
This program allows me to find relevant information quickly using the statusOnHour(hour) method, where the program will iterate through an array of staff, their start times, calculated break times, and home time, to extract and show the user all staff that require breaks within any hour of the day. 
The Breaktime method makes records and displays returning time in the statusOnHour method. 
The calledSick(name) method checks with the array of data, whethe the submitted name is included in the array, and if so records them as sick. CalledSickList() will list all sick staff members.
